The client sends data to the server only when the object dragged has come to a final position. This reduces the load on the client and the server by a huge margin. 
When 2 clients try to move the same object simultaneously, the client to drop the object last will win. 
The movements are much smoother as the client doesn't send anything when the object is being moved.
